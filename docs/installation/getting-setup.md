## Common Issues & Fixes

### "The bot isn't responding to the prefix I gave it"

The most common cause of this is empty spacing before or after the prefix in the `.env` file; if this is not the cause and you have tried multiple prefixes, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/AngelNull/expandable-djs-bot/issues/new/choose).

### "The bot won't respond to developer commands"

In order for the bot to respond to your developer commands; you must give it your discord ID, this is not the same as your discord username. For more information about discord IDs, [check here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID).

### "The bots custom presence isn't changing from online"

If the bots Status \(the indicator on its profile\) isn't updating, this is most likely because it hasn't been given enough time to update, please allow 5 minutes after restarting the bot for it to take effect.

### "The bots activity/status isn't changing"

You have either entered a status that is too long for discord, given it an invalid activity type or not enabled custom activity in the config.
